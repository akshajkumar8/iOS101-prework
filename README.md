## App Brainstorming

My favorite applications and features that make them my favorite app:

App: Notes
Clean and easy-to-use user interface
Various formatting options like changing font size, making checklists, etc.

App: Snapchat
AR filters and lenses are fun
Camera app combined with messaging is very nice

App: Photos
Can search entire photo library for all photos that have a specific object
Many features for editing photos and also makes slideshows with music

App: Weather
Animations and graphics are nice
Displays helpful information in a clean way

My App Idea:

I always struggle to decide which restaurant I want to go to or order from and it takes me a lot of time, so I want to make a restaurant decider app. Ideally, it would find all open restaurants within a certain distance like 5-10 miles away from the user. It would then show the names of two restaurants side by side and have a timer for 5 seconds, so that the user can select which restaurant he/she prefers under stress. Eventually, the user could land on one final restaurant after going through all of the options and finally know where he/she wants to eat from. I would have to use an API, but I am unsure of how to display the two restaurants and figure out the logic for that.

## Notes

The only challenge I encountered when building this app was that the Assistant was not showing up with the ViewController file in my Xcode, but that was fixed when I restarted Xcode entirely.
